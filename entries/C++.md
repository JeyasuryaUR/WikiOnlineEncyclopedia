**C++** is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist **Bjarne Stroustrup**.

First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; modern C++ currently has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

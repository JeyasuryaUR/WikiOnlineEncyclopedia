
**Java** is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

The syntax of Java is similar to [C](/wiki/C) and [C++](/wiki/C++), but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. 

Java was originally developed by **James Gosling** at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.
